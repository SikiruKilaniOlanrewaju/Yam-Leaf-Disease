    This application uses **deep learning** techniques to detect Yam Leaf Disease Especially the Anthracnose.
    It leverages **transfer learning** with a pre-trained base model to accurately identify diseases:
    
    **Key symptoms include**:
- **Leaves**: Yellowing, necrotic spots, and lesions.
- **Tubers**: Soft rot, dark lesions, and sunken spots.
- **Vines**: Wilting and dieback.

    **How it works:**
    1. Upload a leaf image.
    2. The model predicts whether the leaf is **healthy** or **affected** by a disease.
    3. It will display the confidence level of the prediction.

# Main content
st.markdown("""
Welcome to the **Yam Anthracnose Leaf Disease Detection** tool! This app helps farmers, researchers, and plant enthusiasts detect diseases affecting various plants through deep learning. Simply upload a leaf image, and our model will quickly analyze it and provide the result with a confidence level.

#### **Yam Anthracnose Disease Overview:**
Yam Anthracnose, caused by the fungus *Colletotrichum spp.*, is a destructive disease that affects yam plants, especially during the humid growing seasons. The disease primarily impacts yam tubers, leaves, and vines, leading to rotting, lesions, and reduced crop yield. Farmers often face significant losses due to this disease, and early detection is crucial to prevent widespread damage.

Early detection and management practices such as fungicide application, proper spacing, and using resistant yam varieties are essential to control the spread of Anthracnose. This app aims to assist in the early diagnosis of such diseases, ensuring better crop health and increased yields.
