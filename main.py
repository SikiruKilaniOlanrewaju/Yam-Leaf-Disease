This application uses deep learning techniques to detect various leaf diseases based on uploaded images. 
The model is built using transfer learning, leveraging a pre-trained base model to identify diseases in different types of plants.

Please upload a leaf image of **Apple, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Peach, Pepper, Potato, Strawberry**, or **Tomato** for accurate predictions.
